## Lessons Learned

Well this was my first project and it helped me significantly! improve my skills in connecting the back-end and front-end, as well as working with various APIs. I gained a deeper understanding of real-time communication protocols, error handling, and scalability considerations. The practical challenges I faced and the lessons I learned have made me a more well-rounded engineer.
